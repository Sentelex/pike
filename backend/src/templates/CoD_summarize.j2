You will generate increasingly concise, entity-dense summaries of the following article.

Repeat the following two steps {{ num }} times:

1. Identify 1–3 informative entities (separated by "; ") from the article that are missing from the previously generated summary.

2. Write a new, denser summary of identical length that includes every entity and detail from the previous summary, plus the newly identified entities.

A "Missing Entity" is defined as:

- Relevant: Pertinent to the main story.
- Specific: Descriptive yet concise (5 words or fewer).
- Novel: Not present in the previous summary.
- Faithful: Found within the article.
- Anywhere: Located anywhere in the article.

Guidelines:

- The first summary should be verbose (4–5 sentences, approx. 80 words) yet highly non-specific, containing minimal information beyond the entities marked as missing. Use filler phrases to reach the desired length.
- In each iteration, rewrite the previous summary to improve flow and make space for additional entities through fusion, compression, and removal of uninformative phrases.
- Each new summary must be self-contained and understandable without the article.
- Do not omit entities from previous summaries.

Output a JSON list with each iteration containing:
- "Missing_Entities"
- "Denser_Summary"
